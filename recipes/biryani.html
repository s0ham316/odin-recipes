    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a fragrant rice dish made by layering marinated chicken with partially cooked basmati rice and aromatic spices. Start by marinating 500g chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt for at least 30 minutes. In a large pot, fry sliced onions in oil until golden, then add the marinated chicken and cook until it’s halfway done. Meanwhile, parboil 2 cups basmati rice with whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, and cardamom. In the same pot, layer the chicken and rice, sprinkle fried onions, mint, and coriander between layers, and drizzle with saffron milk.</p>
    <p>Seal the pot with a tight lid or dough and cook ("dum") on low heat for about 25–30 minutes until the chicken is tender and rice is fully cooked. Let it rest for 10 minutes before gently mixing. Serve hot with raita or a simple salad for a complete meal bursting with flavor and aroma.</p>
