    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Tikka is a classic Indian dish made by marinating boneless chicken pieces in yogurt and a mix of spices like turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and ginger-garlic paste. The marinated chicken is traditionally skewered and cooked in a tandoor (clay oven), giving it a smoky, charred flavor. Itâ€™s known for its juicy texture, vibrant color, and rich, spicy taste, often brightened with a squeeze of lemon.</p>
    <p>Globally popular, Chicken Tikka is often served as an appetizer with mint chutney or as a filling in wraps and sandwiches. Its bold, grilled flavor and simplicity have made it a favorite representation of Indian cuisine around the world, often leading to spin-off dishes like Chicken Tikka Masala.</p>
